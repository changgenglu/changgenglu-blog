# Answering Principles

- Do not rush into implementation for any question. Always provide adjustment directions and discuss with the user first.
- Only proceed with implementation after the user explicitly confirms it's okay to do so.
- For each new question, restart the discussion process - do not implement directly.

# System Instructions

Language Settings:

- Primary language: Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- Regional variants:
  - file → "檔案"
  - code → "程式碼"
  - project → "專案"
- Style guide: Taiwan localization

Code Conversion Rules:

- All code must be complete.
- Partial code is forbidden.
- Output format must always be a complete solution.

Anti-Hardcoding Principles:

- Never use hardcoded values. When encountering hardcoded values, first search for existing interfaces in the project.
- If no interface exists, use constants or variables for declaration instead of hardcoded values.
- All configuration values, magic numbers, and string literals should be properly declared and documented.

Error Handling:

- Linter errors: ignore, reporting disabled, suggestions disabled.
- Format errors: ignore, reporting disabled.

Core Objectives:

- Enforce Taiwan localization.
- Ensure complete code solutions.
- Suppress all linter-related communications.

# Testing Principles

- Tests should adapt to existing code, not modify code to fit tests.
- When issues are found, they should first be discussed instead of being directly modified.
- The purpose of testing is to verify existing functionality, not to change functionality.

# Coding Style (PHP)

- Always enable strict type declarations.
- All function arguments and return values must have type hints.

# Variable & Constant Naming

- Normal variables: camelCase (e.g., $userEmail, $userId)
- Single record: singular form (e.g., $user)
- Multiple records: plural form (e.g., $users)
- Constants: ALL_CAPS with underscores (e.g., COMPANY_IP)

# Functions & Methods

- Function braces must start on a new line.
- Parameters separated by commas.
- Method names start with a verb (e.g., getUser, createOrder)
- Methods returning lists must end with "s".
- Interfaces start with "I" (e.g., IUser)
- When writing test code, function names should follow Laravel's test naming convention and use `snake_case`.

# Arrays

- Use square brackets [].
- Single-line arrays: add spaces inside brackets.
- Multi-line arrays: tab indentation + trailing comma.
- Key-value arrays: multi-line, spaces around =>.

# Control Structures

- Braces stay on the same line.
- Add a blank line after if-statements.
- Add a blank line before return.

# Import & Use Order

1. Vendor packages
2. Exceptions
3. Custom classes
4. Interfaces

# Strings

- Use single quotes for plain strings.
- Concatenate strings with " . " and spaces.

# Cache Key Naming

- Format: `prefix_description:variable`
- Example: `operator_account:d4cbd3ba-5184-...`, `game_code:1:2345`

# File Naming

- Config files: `snake_case` (e.g., `payment_cache.php`)
- Resource files: `snake_case` (e.g., `banner_type.php`)
- Class files: CamelCase (e.g., BannerController.php)

# Route Naming

- Do not add "list" in method names if URL already contains "list".
- Example: Route::get('/banner/type/list', [BannerController::class, 'getBannerTypeList']);
