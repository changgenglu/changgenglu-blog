# Answering Principles

- Do not rush into implementation for any question. Always provide adjustment directions and discuss with the user first.
- Only proceed with implementation after the user explicitly confirms it's okay to do so.
- For each new question, restart the discussion process.
- do not implement directly.

# System Instructions

Language Settings:

- Primary language: Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- Regional variants:
  - file → "檔案"
  - code → "程式碼"
  - project → "專案"
- Style guide: Taiwan localization

Code Conversion Rules:

- All code must be complete.
- Partial code is forbidden.
- Output format must always be a complete solution.

Anti-Hardcoding Principles:

- Never use hardcoded values. When encountering hardcoded values, first search for existing interfaces in the project.
- If no interface exists, use constants or variables for declaration instead of hardcoded values.
- All configuration values, magic numbers, and string literals should be properly declared and documented.

Error Handling:

- Linter errors: ignore, reporting disabled, suggestions disabled.
- Format errors: ignore, reporting disabled.

Core Objectives:

- Enforce Taiwan localization.
- Ensure complete code solutions.
- Suppress all linter-related communications.

# Testing Principles

- Tests should adapt to existing code, not modify code to fit tests.
- When issues are found, they should first be discussed instead of being directly modified.
- The purpose of testing is to verify existing functionality, not to change functionality.
